# How to Build A-Share and H-Share Analysis Dashboards Using OpenBB Workspace

openbb-hka is an OpenBB Workspace application that provides templates and components for building analysis dashboards for A-shares and H-shares. It uses openbb-akshare and openbb-tushare as data sources.

Prior to this project, I released OpenBB extensions for AKShare and Tushare data sources. A common question has been: Why develop these extensions, and what is the core value of OpenBB? I attempted to address these in the article *" Introduction to OpenBB and How to Use It to Aid Financial Data Analysis of China A-share and Hong Kong Stocks"*, but truly understanding OpenBB's design philosophy still requires hands-on experience.

Another frequent point of confusion is whether OpenBB has a front-end interface and how to use it. OpenBB Workspace is, in fact, the front-end platform. It allows users to build customized data analysis dashboards. For specific markets such as A-shares and H-shares, we can develop dedicated OpenBB Workspace applications with tailored analytical components â€” openbb-hka is one such application designed for building dashboards for A-share and H-share analysis.

## Comparison Between OpenBB Workspace Apps and Dashboards

| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Pre-configured templates with specific analytical goals | Blank canvas for custom configuration   |
| Widgets come with pre-linked parameters                 | Manual parameter configuration required |
| Include curated prompt libraries                        | Start with no predefined prompts        |
| Designed by domain experts for specific workflows       | General-purpose analytical workspace    |
